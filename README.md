### Project descripti√≥n
We have developed a frontend web application to simulate the management of appointments in a tattoo studio centre, in which we have mainly used the tools of React vite, redux, mui core, to generate the various different managements such as: registration, login, appointment booking, user creation in case of being super administrator, users can select the tattoo of their choice, then fill out a form to make their appointment.
